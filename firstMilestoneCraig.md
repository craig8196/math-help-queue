### First Milestone

* Aided in organizing the proposal primarily in the feature's section.
* Helped design the wireframe mockup, building off of Ryan's ideas.
* Designed the [database relational model](databaseDesign.pdf).
* Finished the [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for building a simple blog with rails.
* Researched and read many articles on both how to use Ruby and how to build applications in Rails.
* Created part of the model using the rails generator.
* Started a simple authentication system which automatically adds a user to the database.
  This will be helpful in getting sessions working, and when testing the general functionality of our site.
* Created the README.md.
* Started a board at trello.com to help aid in coordinating coding as the project grows.
