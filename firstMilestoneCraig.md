### First Milestone

* Aided in organizing the proposal primarily in the feature's section.
* Helped design the wireframe mockup, building off of Ryan's ideas.
* Designed the [database relational model](databaseDesign.pdf).
* Finished the [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for building a simple blog with rails.
* Researched and read many articles on both how to use Ruby and how to build applications in Rails.
* Created part of the model using the rails generator.
* Started a simple authentication system which automatically adds a user to the database.
  This will be helpful in getting sessions working, and when testing the general functionality of our site.
  Full authentication can be added easily after all the required features are implemented.
* Created the README.md.
* Started a board at trello.com to help aid in coordinating coding as the project grows.
