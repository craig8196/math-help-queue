#First Milestone - Ryan

I created a large part of basic wireframe which was edited, changed, and built upon 
by other members of the group.

I have spent a few hours trying to learn Ruby on Rails, following a tutorial
that is given to create a blog using Rails.

I spent several hours trying to install the mysql2 gem on my machine, so that I
could use mysql2 with Rails as a database, but so far I have not been successful
in doing that. I may continue using sqlite3 on my personal machine if I can.

#Second Milestone - Ryan

I got the database working and spent time syncing up with what other group members
were doing. 

I spent a decent amount of time building a create account page, until I realized
that it was not necessary because we were logging in through the BYU LDAP system which
Craig got working.

I designed the CSS file and experimented with different colors and styles. I figured out how to
integrate CSS with Ruby on Rails tags. I added connectivity from the home page to the add course
page.
