Project Style Guide
===================

### Indentation

* Use two (2) space indent.

### Functions, Arrays, and Hashes

* Use parenthesis, brackets, and braces where appropriate to ensure disambiguation and readability.  This may seem like a no-brainer, however, Ruby doesn't require parenthesis for function calls, arrays/list, and hashes.
