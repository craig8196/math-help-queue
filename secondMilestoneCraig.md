### Second Milestone

For the Second Milestone I was able to add relations to the Rails Model so that Users, Courses, Privileges, and Requests are all related.
Additionally, I was able to figure out how to use BYU's LDAP server to authenticate a user so a student would be able to use their BYU NetId and Password to login and have an account automatically created for them.
I wanted to add the ability for the server to request course information, first name, last name, email address, etc., from the LDAP server as well.  Unfortunately, after several hours of research and experimentation I couldn't get the software to work.
